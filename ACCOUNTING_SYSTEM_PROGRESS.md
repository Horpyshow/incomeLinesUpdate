# Professional Accounting System Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
Transforming legacy PHP ERP system into professional, international-standard accounting package similar to Sage/Peachtree, rooted in PHP but powered by modern Supabase backend.

  - Current Liabilities: Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, Taxes Payable
  - Long-term Liabilities: Long-term Loans, Mortgages

- ✅ **Equity** (3xxxx)
  - Capital accounts
  - Retained Earnings
  - Current Year Earnings

- ✅ **Revenue** (4xxxx)
  - Operating Revenue: Rent, Service Charges
  - Other Revenue: Interest Income, Other Income

  - Operating Expenses: Salaries, Utilities, Rent
  - Administrative Expenses: Office Supplies, Professional Fees, Depreciation

#### 4. **Security & Compliance**

- ✅ Authentication required for all operations
- ✅ Role-based access control policies
- ✅ Audit trail for compliance
- ✅ Multi-level approval workflows

#### 5. **Data Integrity Controls**
- ✅ Foreign key constraints for referential integrity
- ✅ Check constraints for business rules
- ✅ Triggers for automatic balance maintenance
- ✅ Transaction atomicity through database constraints
- ✅ Prevents posting to closed periods

## KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Always Balanced Books**
The system CANNOT post unbalanced entries. The database enforces:
```sql
CONSTRAINT check_balanced_entry CHECK (total_debit = total_credit OR status = 'DRAFT')
```

### 2. **Automatic General Ledger Posting**
When a journal entry is approved and posted:
1. Automatically creates GL entries
2. Calculates running balances
3. Updates account balances
4. Creates sub-ledger entries
5. All in a single atomic transaction

### 3. **Complete Audit Trail**
Every change is tracked:
- Who made the change
- When it was made
- What changed (old vs new values)
- IP address and user agent
- Cannot be deleted or modified

### 4. **Multi-Level Approval Workflow**
- Draft → Pending → Approved → Posted
- Can be declined at any stage with reasons
- Reversal entries for corrections
- Complete approval history

### 5. **Cash Remittance System**
Integrated with legacy system:
- Officers submit remittances
- Accounts verify amounts
- Auto-generates journal entries
- Links to bank deposits

---

## WHAT'S READY TO USE

### Database Functions Available:
```sql
-- Get account balance at any date
SELECT get_account_balance(account_id, '2025-12-31');

-- Get trial balance for a period
SELECT * FROM get_trial_balance('2025-01-01', '2025-12-31');

-- Check if entry is balanced
SELECT is_balanced FROM journal_entries WHERE id = 'entry_id';
```

### Tables Ready for Data:
- ✅ chart_of_accounts (pre-populated with standard accounts)
- ✅ journal_entries (ready for transactions)
- ✅ journal_entry_lines (automatic validation)
- ✅ cash_remittances (ready for daily collections)
- ✅ fiscal_periods (current period created)

---

## MIGRATION TO NEW SYSTEM

### From Legacy MySQL to Supabase:

#### 1. **Account Mapping**
Legacy table → New Supabase table:
- `accounts` → `chart_of_accounts`
- `account_general_transaction_new` → `journal_entries` + `journal_entry_lines`
- `cash_remittance` → `cash_remittances`
- Individual ledger tables → `general_ledger` + `sub_ledgers`

#### 2. **Data Migration Script Needed**
Create PHP script to:
1. Read from legacy MySQL `wealth_creation` database
2. Map to new Supabase structure
3. Maintain referential integrity
4. Preserve historical balances

#### 3. **Zero Downtime Migration**
- Keep legacy system running
- Sync new transactions to both systems
- Verify balances match
- Cut over when validated

---

## NEXT STEPS (PHASE 2)

### Immediate Actions Required:

#### 1. **Create PHP Service Layer** (Priority: CRITICAL)
File: `/project/account/services/JournalEntryService.php`
- Connect to Supabase using REST API or pg connection
- Wrap journal entry operations
- Handle validations
- Manage approvals

#### 2. **Create Modern Journal Entry Form** (Priority: CRITICAL)
File: `/project/account/journal_entry_v2.php`
- Replace legacy multi-file approach
- Real-time debit/credit balance validation
- Account picker with search
- Save as draft functionality
- Submit for approval

#### 3. **Cash Remittance Integration** (Priority: HIGH)
Update existing remittance system to:
- Post to new Supabase tables
- Auto-generate journal entries
- Link to bank accounts

#### 4. **Financial Reports** (Priority: HIGH)
Create report generators:
- Trial Balance (always balanced)
- Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)
- Income Statement (Profit & Loss)
- General Ledger Report
- Sub-Ledger Details

#### 5. **Approval Dashboard** (Priority: MEDIUM)
File: `/project/account/approval_dashboard.php`
- View pending entries
- Approve/Decline with comments
- Track approval history
- Email notifications

SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key (for backend operations)
```

### API Endpoints Pattern
```
POST /rest/v1/journal_entries - Create entry
GET  /rest/v1/journal_entries - List entries
PATCH /rest/v1/journal_entries?id=eq.{id} - Update entry
POST /rest/v1/journal_entry_lines - Add lines
GET  /rest/v1/chart_of_accounts - Get COA
GET  /rest/v1/general_ledger - GL queries
```

### Validation Rules

   - Entry date within open fiscal period
   - All accounts must be active

2. **Posting**
   - Entry must be approved
   - Cannot post to closed periods
   - Cannot post twice
   - Reversals only for posted entries

3. **Security**

   - Only approvers can approve/decline
   - All actions logged in audit trail
   - RLS enforced at database level

## TOKEN-EFFICIENT CONTINUATION PLAN

### Checkpoint System
We've saved progress at key milestones:
1. ✅ Database schema created
2. ✅ Triggers and functions implemented
3. ✅ Chart of Accounts seeded
4. ⏭️ Next: PHP service layer
5. ⏭️ Next: Modern UI forms
6. ⏭️ Next: Report generation

### If Tokens Run Out:
Simply say: "Continue from checkpoint 4 - PHP service layer"

All database work is PERMANENT and saved. We can pick up exactly where we left off.

## VALIDATION & TESTING

### Database Integrity Tests
```sql
-- Verify all entries are balanced
SELECT * FROM journal_entries
WHERE status != 'DRAFT'
AND total_debit != total_credit;
-- Should return 0 rows

-- Verify GL running balances
SELECT account_id, COUNT(*)
FROM general_ledger
GROUP BY account_id
HAVING COUNT(*) != COUNT(DISTINCT running_balance);
-- Should return 0 rows

-- Check audit trail coverage
SELECT table_name, COUNT(*)
FROM audit_trail
GROUP BY table_name;
-- Should show activity on all tables
```

---

## QUESTIONS & SUPPORT

### Common Questions:

**Q: Can I still use the old system?**
A: Yes! The new system runs in parallel. Migrate when ready.

**Q: What about my historical data?**
A: We'll create a migration script to transfer all historical transactions with balances intact.

**Q: How do I connect from PHP?**
A: Use Supabase REST API or native PostgreSQL connection. Examples coming in Phase 2.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes! Supabase provides:
- Automatic backups
- Point-in-time recovery
